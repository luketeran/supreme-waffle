## Design Process
 
For this website, i wanted to first introduce myself, letting the reader/ potential employers to get to know me a bit more. 
for the abouts page i wanted to have a page where i can introduce myself. Give more information and a picture of me, about me and what are the skills that i have. This could entice the potential employers to employ me. For the portfolio page. i wanted to lay out all the education background, my activities that i have participated during the course of studying in different schools. I also wanted to show all my qualifications and work experiences.

As a user, i would want to go to the navigation menu to find all the important details of the website.
